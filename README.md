# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think it would be great for the project to implement some more animation and music as well on the main page, maybe some "coffee shop" type music when you first enter the website, so it feels like you are at a coffee shop.
